# Learnability Pathways - Backend

## Introduction

Visually impaired users, 50 years or older, who are looking to learn Python coding language need a product/platform that is accessible and allows them to easily learn in a way that carefully considers how they receive information. Our goal is to create a product tailored to their needs by using a combination of visual, voice and audio aids along with an artificial intelligence feature to enable them to learn seamlessly and comfortably. Utilizing a Flask API backend with a React frontend, the course data were obtained from the youtube API. OpenAi API and Elevenlabs API are used to leverage accessability.
